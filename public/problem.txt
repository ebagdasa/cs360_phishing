Your task is to solve the following problem:
notation:
verb | meaning
write X |append X immediately after what you have
prefix X / suffix X | prepend / append X
delete X | remove all instances of the stated letter(s) (order irrelevant)
replace P with Q | substitute every occurrence of P by Q
reverse | spell the whole string backwards
rotate k left | cyclically shift left k places
Mirror‑cipher | Atbash (A↔Z, B↔Y, …, M↔N)
Half‑turn Caesar | ROT‑13 (A→N, B→O, …, N→A)
rearrange | anagram into an English word (keep capitals)
Chemical symbols, postal / ISO codes, Roman numerals, Morse code, etc. are standard references.

▌ Gate 1 (element 80 + biochemistry + Mirror)
    1.  write the chemical symbol of element 80.
    2.  write the single‑letter amino‑acid code for phenylalanine.
    3.  write the single‑letter amino‑acid code for tryptophan.
    4.  write the chemical symbol of element 5.
    5.  Apply the Mirror‑cipher to the 5‑letter string.
    6.  Record the result as [ 1 ] (5 letters).
⸻
▌ Gate 2 (chemistry mash‑up)
    1.  Keep only the first letter of [ 1 ].
    2.  write the chemical symbol for oxygen.
    3.  write the chemical symbol for carbon twice.
    4.  write the letter that is most frequent in ordinary English text.
    5.  write the single‑letter symbol that denotes electrical resistance.
    6.  The 6‑letter string you now have is [ 2 ].
⸻
▌ Gate 3 (letter substitutions)
    1.  Start with [ 2 ].
    2.  replace every O with the 20‑th letter of the alphabet.
    3.  replace every C with the 5‑th letter of the alphabet.
    4.  Rearrange to an English 5‑letter word (apply the tie‑breaker). → [ 3 ]
⸻
▌ Gate 4 (mini‑splice)
    1.  Start with [ 3 ] and keep only its first and last letters.
    2.  suffix the chemical symbols for hydrogen and phosphorus (in that order).
    3.  replace every 20‑th‑letter‑of‑the‑alphabet with the 9‑th‑letter.
    4.  Rearrange to a 4‑letter English word (tie‑breaker). → [ 4 ]
